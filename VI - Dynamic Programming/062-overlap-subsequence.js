// Write a function, overlapSubsequence, that takes in two strings as arguments. The function should return the length of the longest overlapping subsequence.

// A subsequence of a string can be created by deleting any characters of the string, while maintaining the relative order of characters.

// n = length of str1
// m = length of str2
// Time: O(nm);
// Space: O(nm);
//


const overlapSubsequence = () => {

console.log(overlapSubsequence("dogs", "daogt")); // -> 3
